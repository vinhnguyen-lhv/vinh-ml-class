    "- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation:** Impute the missing Education value by averaging the values from the most similar records based on Age and CreditScore.\n",

    "- **Mean/Median Imputation:** Replace missing Education values with the mean or median Education value from similar records.\n",
